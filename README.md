# Customer Satisfaction Prediction

This project is a Flask web application designed to collect customer feedback and predict satisfaction using a pre-trained machine learning model. The application allows users to fill out a form with various customer satisfaction metrics, which are then used to make a prediction.

## Features

- **Customer Satisfaction Form**: A form where users can input their feedback.
- **Prediction**: The model predicts whether the customer is satisfied or not based on the provided inputs.
- **Data Storage**: Customer feedback is stored in an SQLite database for future reference.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database engine used to store customer feedback.
- **Joblib**: For loading the pre-trained machine learning model.
- **HTML/CSS**: For building the frontend interface.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
